# python-gui

</p> A very simple GUI application using Python's tkinter interface. Was part of a mini-project for a course taken during Spring 2024. </p>

<p>The main constraints for this project were to build a GUI utilizing tkinter and also apply basic OOP concepts in Python.</p>

The application has the following features:
  - Responsive UI, allowing the user to scale the input screen up or down depending on device
  - A variety of common car maintenance options and their corresponding prices. Each option can be selected or de-selected by clicking the appropriate checkbox.
  - When options are finalized, the user can click "Display Charges" to receive a summary and total cost of their selections in receipt format.
